-= General =-

The game keeps all the configurable data in config files. Most of the program setting's are going to be in the
SetingsRepository object but classes can read their own config files as well.

The config files must keep the same format as this.
- The root node is called <config>
- Inside the root node is a node called <settings>. This is a generic node containing a list of nodes of
    various names. The <settings> node is used to contain settings meant to be inserted into the SettingsRepository.
    The node name is the parameter name and the content is the parameter value.
    When a class is managing the content of an XML file, it should extract all the settings sub-nodes and
    put them inside the SettingsRepository.
- The rest of the nodes in the root, other than setting, can be named whatever,    


The game does not keep an hardcoded reference to each of the config file names, instead there is a core config
file called 'config.xml'. This file is read first and each other XML file's path is kept in there.

There is a facility method in SettingsRepository that loads all the general settings from an XML file and inserts
them.
