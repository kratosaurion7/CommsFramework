Mandate #001 : 

Add procedure in BaseSprite called SetTextureName(std::string textureName)

All textures have a name and may have a file path (Textures from spritesheets have the sheet's path as their filepaths)

Can call SetTextureName with a texture name and the engine will search around for a texture with that name and appy it.
If the texture does not exists, it will keep it in mind and when the texture is loaded the engine can scan for all the sprites
that are missing their textures to see if it can apply the new textures to sprites.
