Items needed to rework the Map classes from an unusable bunch of complicated crap to a simple working mechanism.

- Remove World, AreaGrid and LocalGrid
- Make class named Map
- Maps are loaded from the MapLoader class, they can be loaded from files (or other)
- Maps are grids of tiles that the player can walk on. The camera decides what tiles are seen on the screen.
